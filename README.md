**DETAILS**
I used the R programming language for data preparation and customer/workforce trend analytics. I also did uplift testing and data visualization (Tableau) to extract valuable business insights.

**RESULT**
I identified benchmark stores used to test the impact of the trial store layouts on customer sales. I also provided data-driven suggestions to the organizations.
